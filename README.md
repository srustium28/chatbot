# chatbot
A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human.

-The Dataset
The dataset we will be using is ‘intents.json’. 
This is a JSON file that contains the patterns we need to find and the responses we want to return to the user.

Prerequisites

pip install tensorflow, keras, pickle, nltk
Tensorflow-conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu
keras- conda install -c anaconda keras-gpu
nltk-conda install -c anaconda nltk
pickel-pip install pickle-mixin

Tensorflow-TensorFlow is an open-source software library for numerical computation


Intents.json – The data file which has predefined patterns and responses.
train_chatbot.py – In this Python file, we wrote a script to build the model and train our chatbot.
Words.pkl – This is a pickle file in which we store the words Python object that contains a list of our vocabulary.
Classes.pkl – The classes pickle file contains the list of categories.
Chatbot_model.h5 – This is the trained model that contains information about the model and has weights of the neurons.
Chatgui.py – This is the Python script in which we implemented GUI for our chatbot. Users can easily interact with the bot.

Run the chatbot
To run the chatbot, we have two main files; train_chatbot.py and chatapp.py.
Summary
In this Python data science project, we understood about chatbots and implemented a deep learning version of a chatbot 
in Python which is accurate. You can customize the data according to business requirements and train the chatbot with great accuracy. 
Chatbots are used everywhere and all businesses is looking forward to implementing bot in their workflow.
